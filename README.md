Per instruction from ICP1, I created a local repo in my laptop. It has 2 sub-folders. One is called source and the other is called
is documentation. I took a screenshot of the local repo folders and place it on the documentation folder and then pushed it up to remote
repo in Github cloud. Then I placed an index.html file on the local source folder repo and pushed it out to Source folder on remote repo
